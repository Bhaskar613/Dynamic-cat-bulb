# Cat & Bulb Switcher

This project demonstrates a simple interactive web application where you can switch a bulb on and off, and see a cat's eyes change accordingly.

## Features

- **Switch On/Off**: Click the "ON" or "OFF" buttons to toggle the bulb and cat images.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The bulb and cat images, as well as the switch status, update dynamically based on user interaction.

## Files

### [cb.html](cb.html)

The main HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including:
- A bulb image (`id="bulbImage"`)
- A cat image (`id="catImage"`)
- A switch board with "ON" and "OFF" buttons.

### [cb.css](cb.css)

The CSS file styles the page, including:
- Dark background for the page.
- Styling for the bulb and cat images.
- Styling for the switch board and buttons.

### [cb.js](cb.js)

The JavaScript file provides interactivity:
- `switchOn()`: Turns the bulb on and changes the cat image.
- `switchOff()`: Turns the bulb off and changes the cat image.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `cb.html` in any modern web browser.
